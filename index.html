		<p>We are a family of 3: my daughter Anna, myself and my husband Andrew. My daughter is 6 years old now and for 2 years she has been asking for a cat as a gift for herself on all holidays. Due to the fact that the war started in our country, we postponed this issue until better times. But for this New year, I decided that it was time and Santa Claus brought us a little fluffy miracle under the Christmas tree. We named him Leo. He is smart, kind and the best friend for my daughter and now a member of our family. If you want to see some Leo's photo please foolow the link.</p>
